                <p>Hoot Art Gallery is located in the historic, peaceful village of Placitas, with dramatic views of the Sandia Mountains, hiking and biking trails, and a myriad of flora and fauna, including wild horses.</p>
                <p>The area attracted many talents: artists, authors, intellectuals, musicians, naturalists, philanthropists and professionals from various fields. It grew into a thriving artistic community.</p>
                <p>At Hoot, we are proud to promote local and Southwestern artists and their work; which exemplifies a wide variety of genres and styles, from representational form, often using experimental methods, to the abstract.</p>
                <p>At our gallery, you will find items from painting, jewelry and wearable arts, to pottery, fine woodworking and glass.</p>
                <p>The rich selection of books, fine art photography, and paintings often depict southwestern themes.</p>
                <p>Hoot is pleased and honored to continue the effort originated by Arte de Placitas.</p>
